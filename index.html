  <div class="about">
    <p>
        Morgan is a Portland-based choreographer and web developer. Her choreography has been shown in Chicago and New York City. Her traveling impovisational series, <a href="http://instagram.com/explore/tags/roadtripdance">#RoadTripDance</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/explore/tags/spacesuitdance">#SpaceSuitDance</a>, have taken place across the United States and can be found on Instagram.

  <div class="about">
    <p>
        Her choreographic focus has shifted from stage to site-specific work. While living in Los Angeles, the multitude of outdoor open spaces begged to be utilized for movement. She sees her site-specific creations as a reclamation of space that is especially important for women who are overwhelmingly socialized to take up less. She looks forward to continuing her exploration of Portland's parks and hidden places.

  <div class="about">
      <p>
        Morgan finds many parallels between choreography and web development and is eager to continue making connections. When she is not creating movement or learning to program, she can be found in ballet class, petting Portland cats and recruiting people into her girl gang.
