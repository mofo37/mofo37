    <p>
        Morgan is a San Francisco-based choreographer and web developer. Her choreography has been shown in Chicago and New York City.

  <div class="about">
    <p>
        Morgan is thrilled to have embarked on a journey in web development. She feels comfortable knowing that there will always be new technology to learn. She has been enthralled with vanilla JavaScript and very excited about writing Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain. When she's not learning more about Solidity she is creating a daily outfit picker app using React and Node.js.

  <div class="about">
      <p>
        Morgan finds many parallels between choreography and web development and is eager to continue making connections. When she is not creating movement or learning to program, she can be found wandering the SF streets, recruiting people into her girl gang or petting her roommate's cat.
